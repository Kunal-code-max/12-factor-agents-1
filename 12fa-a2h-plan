## Goals

A working implementation of 

npx create-12-factor-agent

that follows the basic template in packages/create-12-factor-agent/template

includes by default:
- typescript 


- everything in the package should be usable as a standalone package and exported, to support:
- a npx @humanlayer/create command to create a new 12-factor agent with `humanlayer: true`


### python pacakge

A python repo template similar to the typescript template, but uses python and uv instead of typescript.

A working implementation of 
`uvx create-12-factor-agent` that follows
all the above goals, but uses python to create the repo and uses a python repo template. all other flags and toggles are the same
