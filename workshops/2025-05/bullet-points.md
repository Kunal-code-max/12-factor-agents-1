Load Categories (36:10-36:12): The process begins with loading categories from a specified source.
Define Category Structure (36:17-36:27): Establishes a structure for categories, including both embedding text (for vector database searches) and a description for the language model (LLM).
Narrow Down Categories (36:29-36:40): Creates a function to reduce the number of categories based on input text, utilizing vector database queries or other methods.
Pick Best Category (36:42-37:57): Implements a function to select the most appropriate category from a refined list using an LLM, with dynamic enum creation.
Embedding Creation (38:06-39:04): Generates embeddings for categories to facilitate semantic searches and similarity comparisons.
Cosine Similarity Matching (39:04-39:40): Uses cosine similarity to find the best matches between the user query and category embeddings.
Match Sorting (39:41-40:04): Sorts the matches to identify the most relevant categories.
Dynamic Enum Building (41:02-44:09): Constructs enums dynamically to represent categories, enhancing type safety and LLM interaction.
Alias Implementation (45:09-46:07): Adds aliases to categories for improved prompt clarity and LLM focus.
Category Selection and Return (47:08-48:12): Selects and returns the final category based on LLM output, ensuring type consistency.
